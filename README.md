## Recommendations

- I found that sidebar menu for mobile device was not implemented in the design.

- Font family :
  Museo Sans Rounded was not available on google fonts resources, so I had to use poppins as an alternative since it is also a rounded font format.

- User photo was not available on the internal design resources, so I had to pull an external photo .
